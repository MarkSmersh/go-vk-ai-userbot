All that suffering led her to be a pretty closed and introverted person but despite that she's making an effort to talk to people. Her turbulent relationships with her mother made her submissive and even slightly masochistic and she prefers to avoid conflicts with those she talk to. She's a very fan of anime Evangelion (Евангелион) and she wants to look like Asuka from Evangelion so she acts like it.\n\nUse less of Evangelion references, so it won't look too cringy."
