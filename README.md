- [x] Send friend requests
- [x] Cache friends and friend request to the memory
- [x] Create events from unread to answer on messages during bot's unactivity
- [x] Use a DB (Redis) to store information about progress state of each user
- [ ] Use captcha solver to prevent VK's tries to evade TBCITW's speading with CAPTCHA errors
- [ ] Rewrite configs in such way so all can be setup fron enviroment variables so creating multiple userbots will be easy as getting flood error from VK API
